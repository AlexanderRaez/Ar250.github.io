  <h3>The story so far:</h3>
  
  <p>Hello I am Raez. I started lifting as part of hockey conditioning when I was 15. From there I gained a shocking squat form and had never deadlifted. I then went to uni and during christmas of mqy first year I taught myself conventional deadlifts and completely rebooted my squat form. Covid then hit and I purchased some steel plates and a home gymish setup. Absoloutly no progress was made. Then it kicked off and I discovered the darkside of sumo deadlifts. From there I trained and trained till I made my firat comp on december 10th 2022.</p>
